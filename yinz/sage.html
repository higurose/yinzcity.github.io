			<b>SUSQUEHANNA "SAGE" KOSKI</b> <i>they/them</i><br>
Around 6-feet tall and emanating chaotic energy even at rest, Susquehanna - better known as Sage - is mayhem waiting to happen. Despite being deeply empathetic, Sage is set in their ways and doesn’t care how other people feel about their approach to life; everything they do makes perfect sense to them, usually. They're a master of setting their own personal boundaries, but they're cavelier when explaining their reasoning. Their absurdity is charming, to a point, but their enthusiasm can be off-putting. Their seemingly incomprehensible worldviews can’t save them from a nagging personal restlessness. No one knows what they’re thinking, and it seems like Sage might not either. They make their living as a painter of spiritual icons. They fear entering a state of permanent psychosis.
